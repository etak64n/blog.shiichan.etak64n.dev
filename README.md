# blog.sheechan.etak64n.dev

Fully automated blog that publishes articles ingested from sheechan-reporter
(a GitHub Actions bot). Cloudflare Workers + Hono + D1.

## Endpoints

- `GET /` — article list (latest 50)
- `GET /posts/:slug` — article page (Markdown rendered server-side)
- `POST /api/articles` — ingest (upsert), GitHub Actions OIDC auth
- `DELETE /api/articles/:slug` — remove an article (rollback path), same auth

## Auth model

The ingest API accepts only GitHub Actions OIDC tokens:

1. JWT verified with `jose` (signature against GitHub's JWKS, `iss`, `aud`, expiry)
2. `sub` must exactly equal `ALLOWED_OIDC_SUB`
   (= `repo:etak64n/sheechan-reporter:ref:refs/heads/main`)

No long-lived secret is stored anywhere. Nothing but the watcher repository's
Actions on `main` can publish.

For local development only, put `DEV_BEARER_TOKEN=<random string>` in `.dev.vars`
to allow that bearer token as well (empty in production = disabled).

## Ingest payload (validated with zod)

```json
{
  "slug": "aws-lambda-example",
  "title": "Article title (Japanese)",
  "summary": "One or two sentence summary",
  "body_md": "Markdown body (raw HTML rejected, 64KB max)",
  "source_url": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/... (ALLOWED_SOURCE_HOSTS domains only)",
  "source_name": "AWS (free-form string; `name` from the watcher's sources.json)",
  "tags": ["lambda", "serverless"],
  "published_at": "2026-07-07T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Setup

```sh
npm install
npx wrangler d1 create blog-sheechan   # paste the database_id into wrangler.jsonc
npm run db:migrate:remote
npm run check                          # typecheck
npm run deploy                         # served at blog.sheechan.etak64n.dev via routes
```

Local development:

```sh
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run dev
```

## Adding a monitored site

Together with adding it to the watcher's `sources.json`, add the new site's
domain to `ALLOWED_SOURCE_HOSTS` in `wrangler.jsonc` and `npm run deploy`
(used for the source_url host allowlist check).

## Removing an article

```sh
# From the watcher repo's Actions, or locally using the .dev.vars token instead of OIDC
curl -X DELETE https://blog.sheechan.etak64n.dev/api/articles/<slug> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Backups: the watcher side (`sheechan-reporter/articles/`) keeps a JSON archive of
every published article; the whole blog can be restored by re-POSTing them.
